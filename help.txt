Welcome to Baroque!

Here's how you use it:
        Add Baroque to your global path for ease of use.
        Here's the generic outline of a Baroque command:

        Baroque -i [input_file] -c [compare_file] -o [output_file] -b [backend] -r [routing_algorithm] --<metric_test>

        Out of all the arguments there, only input file and backend are necessary.
        However, most arguments can have default values be specified.

Additional Commands:
        You can use any of these commands after the 'Baroque' keyword:
        --input_file=<filename>
        --output_file=<filename>
        --compare_file=<filename>
        --backend=<backend string> OR --backend_input=<backend_string>
                These two commands do the same thing as the short -b command.
        --backend_compare=<backend string>
                Used to set a separate backend for the compare circuit.
        --set_default_<something>=<value>
                This is how you set default values.
                Where <something> is replaced by:
                    input_file, compare_file, output_file, backend_input, backend_compare, routing_input, routing_compare
        --show_defaults
                This will print all defaults you have set.
        --reset_all
                This will reset all default values you have set.
        --set_API_key=<key>
                Use this to set the API key you will use for using IBMQ simulators and machines.
        --available_backends
                Use this to see all available backends to run experiments on.

Available Metrics:
        --metricCountGate=<gate string>
                Count the occurrences of a specific gate.
        --metricRatioGate=<gate string>
                Get the ratio of gate occurrences between two circuits.
        --metricDiffGate=<gate string>
                Find the difference in occurrences of a specific between two circuits.
        --metricCircuitDepth
                Find the depth of the circuit.
        --metricRatioDepth
                Get the ratio of depths between two circuits.
        --metricDiffDepth
                Find the difference in depth between two circuits.
        --metricRaw
                Display raw data about the simulation.

        (gate strings have been defined as per IBM standards)

Good luck :3
